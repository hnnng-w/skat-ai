# Project handoff

This document summarizes the current state of `skat-ai` for continuing development in a new thread or with a new contributor.

## Project overview

`skat-ai` is a local Python-based Skat analysis and simulation tool.

The project focuses on:

* legal-card detection
* rule-based Skat position analysis
* Monte Carlo-style card analysis
* expected point swing estimation
* card recommendations
* multi-step simulation
* opponent policy modeling
* game result and settlement summaries
* automatic matador inference where supported by known declarer-card context and safe local-declarer completed-trick ownership
* post-game review support
* JSON input/output for regression-friendly testing

The project is not a machine-learning model, not a full official tournament system, and not a perfect-information Skat solver.

## Current development style

Development is milestone-based and test-driven. Each milestone is split into small parts.

Each part should:

* add one focused behavior or cleanup
* include tests
* keep existing behavior backward-compatible where possible
* run the full check script before committing

The standard check command is:

```powershell
.\scripts\check.ps1
```

The project check currently covers:

* Ruff checks
* input JSON schema validation
* generated output JSON schema validation
* pytest regression tests

## Important assumptions

### Language

Repository code, tests, comments, docstrings, JSON keys, CLI output, and program output should remain in English.

Discussion and planning can be in German.

### Table size

The project assumes a fixed three-player Skat table.

Four-player table support is not a priority unless explicitly requested.

### Performance rating

ISkO-style performance rating is partially implemented for fixed three-player single-game declarer perspective.

Full list, series, and tournament aggregation is not implemented yet.

### Live vs post-game mode

The project separates live decision analysis from post-game review.

`live_decision` is intended for in-game decisions and must not use post-game-only information.

`post_game_review` is intended for completed or retrospectively analyzed games.

## Major completed milestones

### Core rules and simulation

Implemented:

* card notation
* card points
* trump logic
* legal-card detection
* trick winner logic
* immediate trick simulation
* expected point swing calculation
* card recommendation

### Multi-step simulation

Implemented:

* sequential player-action simulation
* configurable card-selection policy
* strict simulation context checks
* policy comparison
* result serialization
* canonical turn-phase-aware opponent preparation
* supported preparation for empty left lead, empty right lead, and right response to an existing left lead
* deterministic `unsupported_turn_phase` stops for valid phases that do not prepare a current local decision

### Game history and scoring

Implemented:

* completed-trick structure validation
* completed-trick sequence validation
* completed-trick winner validation
* explicit and completed-trick point summaries
* game result summaries
* Schneider/Schwarz status summaries

### Game declaration and settlement

Implemented:

* game declaration metadata
* game value summaries for suit, grand, and null games
* automatic matador inference from known declarer cards and safe local-declarer completed-trick ownership where possible
* final single-game settlement summary
* supported Suit/Grand overbid detection
* supported Suit/Grand overbid settlement loss handling

Known remaining areas:

* full official settlement nuance coverage is not complete
* Null-game overbid settlement remains conservative when no required game value is available
* matador inference does not yet reconstruct completed-trick ownership beyond safe local-declarer `cards` and `players` facts

### Game-end handling

Implemented:

* normal completion
* declarer claims remaining tricks
* declarer concedes remaining tricks
* defenders concede remaining tricks
* remaining-point assignment
* adjusted game-result summaries

### Performance rating

Implemented:

* `performance_rating_system`
* partial `isko_list` support
* fixed three-player table assumption
* single-game declarer rating score
* declarer rating points
* counterparty/defender rating points
* clear distinction between settlement score and rating score
* already aggregated list or series totals via `list_performance_input`
* normalized per-game list or series contributions via `list_game_contributions`

Not implemented:

* raw full-game list aggregation
* series aggregation
* tournament aggregation
* full player-by-player list output

### JSON schema validation

Implemented:

* `schemas/input.schema.json`
* `schemas/output.schema.json`
* input example schema validation
* generated output schema validation
* schema validation documentation

### Live-vs-post-game information enforcement

Implemented:

* rejects `live_decision + known_post_game`
* rejects known skat cards in `live_decision`
* rejects ended game reasons in `live_decision`
* requires `post_game_review` for ended game reasons
* rejects complete 120-point game states in `live_decision`
* restricts unverifiable completed-trick winner metadata in `live_decision`
* adds `information_policy_summary` to output
* centralizes information policy in `information_policy.py`

### Left/right opponent policies

Implemented:

* global opponent policy settings remain backward-compatible
* normalized `left_opponent_policy_settings`
* normalized `right_opponent_policy_settings`
* left/right policy input fields
* left/right policy validation
* left/right CLI overrides
* centralized CLI policy choices via `VALID_OPPONENT_CARD_POLICIES`
* left/right settings in output
* left/right settings in multi-step serialization
* left/right settings threaded into multi-step simulation
* opponent lead uses the specific left/right lead policy
* right response uses `right_opponent_policy_settings` when left leads
* profile confidence derived from `games_played`
* profile-confidence conflict resolution for cautious/aggressive preset evidence
* left/right profile-derived presets applied to effective left/right multi-step policies
* explicit side-specific CLI policy overrides applied after profile-derived presets
* shared effective opponent-policy resolver used by immediate, multi-step, and policy-comparison paths
* configured response policies applied to immediate analysis when explicitly activated
* configured response policies applied to multi-step candidate completion when explicitly activated
* sparse activated response-policy maps that preserve legacy basic/random defaults
* opponent lead policies documented as multi-step preparation behavior

Known remaining areas:

* further defender-cooperation strategy can still be improved
* deeper PlayerProfile confidence usage beyond preset selection remains future work

### Defender cooperation

Implemented:

* safe smear while preserving the partner's winning position
* avoiding overtaking a winning partner when a partner-safe legal card exists
* forced partner overtake using the lowest-point legal winning card
* equal-point forced-overtake tie-break using weakest sufficient trick strength
* winning-card selection using the lowest-point legal winner
* equal-point winning-card tie-break using weakest sufficient trick strength
* equal-point safe-smear tie-break using weakest trick strength
* narrow second-hand trump conservation on zero-point non-trump leads when only trump wins and a losing discard exists
* safer discard when the declarer is currently winning and the defender cannot win
* safer defender lead that prefers low-point non-trumps when possible

Issue #22's current heuristic and explainable defender-partnership scope is implemented.

Known remaining areas:

* defender behavior is still heuristic and assumes a fixed three-player table
* partnership inference is strongest in the currently supported second-hand path
* no complete rear-hand partnership model exists yet
* no dedicated null-game defender-partnership strategy exists yet
* no stable declarer/partner identity exists when the local player itself is only known generically as `defender`
* no full partnership/tactical plan model exists yet
* no perfect-information solving, search, machine learning, or hidden-card inference is used

### Post-game review

Implemented:

* optional `actual_card_played` input
* actual-card validation
* legality validation for the actual card
* `post_game_review_summary` output
* comparison between actual and recommended card
* expected point swing difference
* decision quality classification
* decision factors
* decision explanation
* card-rank gap details
* CLI output for post-game review summaries
* unavailable summary when Immediate Analysis is unavailable because there is no current local decision

* `decision_quality`
* `decision_factors`
* `decision_explanation`

## Release status

`v0.3.0` is released and is the current stable baseline.

The `v0.3.0` stabilization issues #40 through #46 are complete:

* #40 Use Null contract objectives for live card recommendations
* #41 Prevent advanced states from double-counting completed-trick points
* #42 Return non-zero exit codes for invalid CLI invocations
* #43 Restore a valid documented default CLI input
* #44 Support `known_to_declarer` Skat visibility consistently
* #45 Validate completed-trick side ownership from cards and player order
* #46 Align runtime validation with documented input bounds and shapes

See [`CHANGELOG.md`](../CHANGELOG.md) for the release-note summary.

`v0.4.0` is in progress as a CLI and user-facing usability milestone. Completed
early `v0.4.0` work includes:

* #47 updated the post-`v0.3.0` roadmap and handoff direction
* #48 improved CLI help text and command discoverability
* #49 added optional `--quiet` mode for JSON-output CLI runs
* #50 expanded generated-output validation for user-facing CLI workflows
* #51 fixed remaining CLI usability validation bugs, including comparison-only and sample-bound handling
* #52 refreshes documentation and curated workflow walkthroughs

## Current milestone

**v0.4.0: CLI and user-facing usability**

Remaining possible scope:

* improve human-readable post-game review CLI wording
* add small workflow examples only when existing fixtures do not already cover the user-facing path
* keep README, examples, schema-validation docs, roadmap, and handoff notes aligned with completed CLI usability behavior

Deferred deeper investigations:

* broad simulation-quality improvements
* expanded scoring or settlement scope outside focused bug fixes
* Null objective, hidden-information sampling, or validation behavior changes that would alter stable behavior
* broad `main.py` refactors or CLI redesigns

## Open future topics

Recommended future topics:

* full ISkO list/series/tournament aggregation
* improved defender cooperation logic
* deeper PlayerProfile confidence usage beyond preset selection
* richer realistic example positions
* richer post-game review examples
* broader matador inference from completed-trick history beyond safe local-declarer ownership facts
* richer explanation details for recommended-card reasoning

These are future candidates, not the remaining focused `v0.4.0` usability scope.
The current milestone should avoid broad simulation, scoring, settlement,
validation, or hidden-information changes unless a focused bug is discovered.
